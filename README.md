# The Impact of Emotional Speech on the Performance of Speaker Recognition

The code was created as part of the scientific project "Initial Analysis of the Impact of Emotional Speech on the Performance of Speaker Recognition on New Serbian Emotional Database". 

The repository consists of three files. The first two "SEAC - neutral.ipynb" and "SEAC - neutral.ipynb" serve to make a comparison between them, as well as selecting the best classifiers for the SEAC base. The third "Comparison of emotions.ipynb" serves to monitor performance of classification changes at different classifiers.
